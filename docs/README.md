## PlantUML Diagrams

### Architecture Diagrams

- **`architecture.puml`** - Overall system architecture showing the interaction between Frontend (React), FastAPI Backend, MCP Toolbox, and BigQuery
- **`detailed-flow.puml`** - Detailed sequence diagram showing the flow of a cost analysis request from user input to response
- **`deployment.puml`** - Cloud Run deployment process from local development to production
